Enhancing Under Water Images using Image Processing
Introduced an effective technique for improving underwater images affected by
scattering and absorption, without the need for specialized hardware or prior
knowledge of underwater conditions or scene structure. This approach involves a
single technique, relying on the fusion of images derived directly from a colorcompensated and white-balanced version of the original degraded image. These
images, along with their corresponding weight maps, are carefully designed to
facilitate the transfer of edges and color contrast to the final output.
To address potential artifacts in the low-frequency components caused by sharp
weight map transitions, we incorporate a multiscale fusion strategy. Through
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our
enhanced images exhibit enhanced exposure in dark areas, improved overall
contrast and sharp edges.
